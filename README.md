This repository is designed to evaluate the performance of TEProf2 on simulation data.

The TEProf2 code has been adapted from the original implementation available at https://github.com/twlab/TEProf2Paper. These modifications were made to ensure compatibility with the updated versions of the Gencode GTF reference file and the Repeatmasker file.
